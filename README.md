# Depennd

A very hacky (incomplete) implementation of a depedently-typed neural net.

Written for [COMSM0018 Applied Deep Learning](https://comsm0018-applied-deep-learning.github.io/) at the University of Bristol.

Forked from Soham Chowdhury (mrkgnao)'s [Idris implementation](https://gist.github.com/mrkgnao/a45059869590d59f05100f4120595623) of Justin Le (mstksg)'s [dependently-typed neural network](https://blog.jle.im/entry/practical-dependent-types-in-haskell-1.html) in Haskell.

Also heavily inspired by Huw Campbell's [Grenade](https://github.com/HuwCampbell/grenade) library.
